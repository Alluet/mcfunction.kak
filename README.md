# mcfunction.kak

This repository provides syntax highlighting for Minecraft function files.
The highlighting is inspired by the appearance of [language-mcfunction](https://github.com/Arcensoth/language-mcfunction), but is in fact a clean room implementation as the XML/YAML is unreadable and does not translate to Kakoune's way of highlighting at all!
